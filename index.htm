                We‚Äôre Anna and Isabelle (Hi! This is Isabelle) and we‚Äôve been regularly running a sorta life appraisal with our pals. When I went freelance, life without progress checks looked scary.
            </p>
            <p>
                We thought, ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt we create a one-to-one, like at work, but with our friends?‚Äô We‚Äôve been running them for six years now, and it‚Äôs proved a really useful forum for us and for others to voice work and life concerns that feel too big or too vulnerable to share in the pub or on Whatsapp.

                <li>We like to break with a potluck lunch. (A potluck is where everyone brings a dish. We find it useful to set a theme eg: soup and salads and delegate out certain items, like coffee, milk, so you don‚Äôt end up with 10 pots of hoummous!)

                We‚Äôve been running You‚Äôre Doing Great! for six years out of a kitchen in a houseshare, it helps to have understanding flatmates. All you need is space for all your invitees and a table is great. We like to run it from someone‚Äôs home because it helps with creating a relaxed atmosphere. A local park could also work well in the summer.
            </p>
            <h4>Can anyone come?</h4>
            <p>
                We‚Äôve always run it as a women-only group, kind of because it started off that way. After a couple of sessions it started to feel like a space without men made it feel like an easier place to voice vulnerabilities. But it‚Äôs up to you!

                Just confirm your attendance by filling out the Doodle, then wait for the big day! We find that 48 hours‚Äô notice for cancellations is a good timeframe if you can't make it - leaving it to the last minute means fewer people to share problems with, and can mess up food plans too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bring a notepad and pen ‚Äì you‚Äôll want to write down some of the helpful things people suggest ‚Äì and make or bring some food. Snacks always go down well to help with the afternoon slump!

And the following year the business had its best year ever. Hearing other people's challenges and stories has helped me be bolder in my own life and work. There's nowhere else I can go for the kind of help I get at YDG."

Everyone who needs one should have an objective forum in which to explore professional and personal dilemmas.

It felt like a safe space in which I could talk about anything. It was also a place where I learned a lot from working through other people‚Äôs goals.
